## :pencil: Description

Easy to use, full-stack (MERN) login system with dynamic navbar and fully responsive for both mobile and desktop usage. Front-end built with Material-UI and is fully customizable. Navbar has a static avatar image for when there is no user logged in. When a user exsists and has an profile image, the image will display in the nvabar. Dropdown menu for the avatar is based on a user present or not. If no user, the only option is Login. However, if a user does exsist then the options are "Profile" and "Logout". Clicking "Profile" will direct you to your own user profile which is editable.
